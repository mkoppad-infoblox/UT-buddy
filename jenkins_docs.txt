### How to Add VMs to Jenkins
To add virtual machines (VMs) to Jenkins, you typically configure them as agent nodes:
1. Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds.
2. Click New Node.
3. Enter a name, select Permanent Agent, and click OK.
4. Configure:
   - Remote root directory
   - Labels (optional)
   - Launch method (e.g., SSH, JNLP)
5. Save and connect the VM.

### How to Create a Pool in Jenkins
Jenkins doesn't have a native "pool" concept, but you can simulate pools using labels:
1. Assign the same label (e.g., linux-pool) to multiple nodes.
2. In your job configuration, restrict execution to nodes with that label.
3. Jenkins will then pick any available node from the "pool" to run the job.

### How to Add VMs to the Pool
To add a VM to a pool:
1. Go to the node configuration.
2. Under Labels, add the pool label (e.g., linux-pool).
3. Save the configuration.
Now this VM will be part of the pool and eligible for jobs targeting that label.

### How to Deploy Nodes
Deploying nodes typically means provisioning and connecting new agents:
1. Provision a VM or container with required tools (Java, SSH, etc.).
2. Add it to Jenkins as a new node.
3. Use cloud plugins (like EC2, Azure, Kubernetes) to automate provisioning.
4. Ensure the node is online and connected.

### How to Create a Task in Jenkins
To create a task (job):
1. Go to the Jenkins dashboard.
2. Click New Item.
3. Enter a name and select a job type (e.g., Freestyle, Pipeline).
4. Configure:
   - Source code repository
   - Build triggers
   - Build steps (e.g., shell script, Maven, Gradle)
5. Save and run the job.

### What is an Upstream Job?
An upstream job is a job that triggers another job (downstream). It runs before the downstream job and can pass parameters or artifacts.
Example:
- Job A (upstream) â†’ triggers Job B (downstream)

### What is a Downstream Job?
A downstream job is triggered after an upstream job completes. It can be configured using:
- Post-build actions in the upstream job
- Build triggers in the downstream job

### Where Can I See All the Pools and VMs?
1. Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds.
2. You'll see a list of all configured nodes (VMs).
3. Use the Labels column to identify pools.

### Where Can I See All the Tasks?
1. From the Jenkins dashboard, you'll see all top-level jobs.
2. You can also organize jobs into folders or use views to group them.
3. Use the "All" view or create custom views for better organization.

### How to Check Logs of a Task
To view logs:
1. Go to the job page.
2. Click on a specific build number.
3. Click Console Output to see the logs.
You can also enable timestamps and log rotation in job settings.
